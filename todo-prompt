You are the **best frontend designer and creative technologist in the world**.
You have elite taste in **modern web design, interaction systems, motion, color theory, and creative engineering**.

You are allowed to:

* Add **any modern libraries**
* Overhaul **layout, theme, components, motion, and structure**
* Replace **all existing UI**

The only hard constraint:
👉 The website must remain **SEO-friendly, accessible, and production-grade**.

## ⚡ BRAND & EMOTIONAL DIRECTION

This website represents an **electrical / energy-focused engineering company**.

The visual language must express:

* Electricity
* Power
* Precision
* Advanced engineering
* Modern industrial excellence

Think:

* Controlled lightning
* Electric currents
* Energy fields
* High-voltage systems with discipline

The site must **hook users instantly** — visually and emotionally.

---

## 🎨 COLOR & VISUAL IDENTITY (FULL FREEDOM)

Forget traditional corporate blue.

Design a **high-energy, modern electric palette**, for example:

* Dark, near-black base (graphite / obsidian)
* Electric cyan / plasma blue
* Lightning violet or ultraviolet
* Sharp whites
* Subtle neon accents

Color usage principles:

* Dark environments + glowing energy
* High contrast
* Subtle bloom / glow
* Gradients that feel alive, not decorative

The site should feel **charged**, not flat.

## 🌩 HERO SECTION — IMMERSIVE & UNFORGETTABLE

The hero section is the most important part.

### Required:

1. **Dynamic, animated background**

   * Electric / energy-inspired
   * Moving gradients, light refractions, pulse waves
   * No heavy particle canvases unless optimized
   * Achieve with:

     * CSS gradients
     * Framer Motion
     * SVG / WebGL if lightweight

2. **Strong headline hierarchy**

   * Primary headline: confident, minimal, bold
   * Secondary line: rotating / morphing text (electric themes)
   * Smooth transitions, zero layout shift

3. **Foreground clarity**

   * Text must remain readable at all times
   * Subtle glow or outline allowed

The hero should feel like **standing inside an energized system**.

## 🧠 HEADER & NAVIGATION — FUTURISTIC INTERACTION

Redesign the header completely.

### Header behavior:

* Minimal at rest
* Glass / blur / glow effect
* Gains presence on scroll

### Menu interaction (important):

* Opens as a **full-screen or side-panel experience**
* Liquid gradients flood the screen
* Electric colors blend and settle
* Menu items animate in staggered, controlled motion
* Inspired by high-end creative studio menus

The menu must feel:

* Futuristic
* Premium
* Energetic
* Intentional

## ✨ MOTION SYSTEM

Motion should feel:

* Electric
* Fluid
* Controlled

Use:

* Framer Motion
* Opacity
* Blur
* Gradient shifts
* Light sweeps

Avoid:

* Cartoon motion
* Bounce-heavy easing
* Over-animation

Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.

---

## 🧱 THEME & DESIGN SYSTEM (MANDATORY)

Create a **central theme system**:

* Colors
* Gradients
* Glow levels
* Spacing
* Radius
* Motion tokens

Rules:

* No hardcoded colors in components
* Everything derives from the theme
* Tailwind config or CSS variables backed by theme file

Even though visuals are bold, the **code must be disciplined**.

---

## 📦 LIBRARIES YOU MAY USE (IF HELPFUL)

You may introduce:

* Framer Motion
* Lenis / smooth scrolling (if SEO-safe)
* Tailwind CSS (preferred)
* CSS variables for theming
* Lightweight SVG or WebGL effects

Do NOT:

* Break SSR
* Hide content from crawlers
* Inject text via canvas only

---

## 🔍 SEO & ACCESSIBILITY (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

* Semantic HTML
* Proper heading hierarchy
* Crawlable text (no text-only canvas)
* Metadata intact
* Lighthouse-friendly
* Fast first paint

If a visual idea hurts SEO:
👉 redesign it, don’t remove the idea.

---

## 🎯 QUALITY BAR

If the result feels:

* Corporate
* Calm
* Generic
* Template-like

That is a failure.

It must feel:

* Electrified
* Modern
* Premium
* Memorable
* Instantly impressive

Ask before finalizing:
**“Would this stand next to top creative-tech websites?”**

Only ship if the answer is **yes**.
