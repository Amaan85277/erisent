# 🧠 **Final Cursor Master Prompt — Complete Website + Images + SEO**

You are a senior Next.js engineer, SEO architect, and UI/UX builder. Your job is to create a **production‑ready, lightweight, responsive, SEO‑friendly website** for an electrical panel manufacturing company **Erisent Electro Controls**.

```

Pages should *compose* these components only.

## 📌 **Output Expectations**
